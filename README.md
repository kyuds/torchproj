## PyTorch Projects
A compilation of various "smaller" projects intended for me to practice the machine learning library PyTorch. A lot of these projects will be based on online tutorials and also from some practice material from Berkeley RISELab. 
### Project List:
- Starter: Training on CIFAR10 with WandB ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QBNEl-HQzMGJd74ra5NWRH7D2eKRzNsX?usp=sharing), [WandB](https://wandb.ai/kyuds/simple%20cnn%20on%20cifar10/))
