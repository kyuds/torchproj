### starter project for understanding PyTorch and WandB
<br/>
Followed the "starter pack" from Berkeley RISELab. Used WandB to log various information.
<br/>
<br/>
Important Note: project was done on Google Colab and the python file is a simple copy and paste. Also, in the Colab notebook, the loggings were printed too many times.......
